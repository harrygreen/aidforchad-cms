## How Aid For Chad started

In 1984 the worst famine in Ethiopia was broadcast on our TV screens.

A few months later a group of friends heard about Chad, a little known African country that was also suffering from famine. Much publicity was broadcast about the famine in Ethiopia through Band Aid and the wonderful support by Bob Geldof, but Chad received no such publicity. It remained a little known country. However, details of the severity of the famine in S. Chad were sent to us in an air mail letter from Sr Dominique, a Missionary, who was begging for help as her people were starving. 

On reading about the famine first hand we desperately wanted to send aid. We were able to raise funds which were then used to buy millet from near by Cameroon.

It couldn't stop there - so "Aid for Chad" was born!

Sadly, a few months later Sr Dominique was air-lifted to the tropical disease hospital in London suffering from malnutrition and amoebic dysentery. She was not expected to live...but she did!!

On meeting her we were immediately inspired to carry on feeding the poor from her Mission in Benoye and a neighbouring mission, Mberi. We were left in no doubt that our vital support reached those in great need. She knew then she would never return to Chad as her health was broken. She simply said to us as she thanked us - "Those lives are in your hands now".

As a result, we planned many activities over the coming years to carry on the life saving work for Benoye and Mberi which still continues today.



## Chad

[Chad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad) (called after Lake Chad) is landlocked in Central Africa and one of the poorest African countries. It was once a French colony and so the main language is French.

63% of the people live in great poverty mainly surviving on grain, vegetables, millet, okra and cassava and most people are subsistence farmers.

Life expectancy is about 54 years. Only 32% of Chadians can read. Access to clean drinking water in Chad is amongst the lowest in the world and without clean water disease is rife .

It is estimated some 16,000 children die every year of diseases associated from the lack of clean water. There is approximately one doctor for 25,000 people. There are 4 hospitals.



## Wells

We have managed to build six wells in both Benoye and Mberi. Before they were dug, the Chadians collected their water from dirty rivers infested with disease. As a result many people and children caught Cholera, diarrhoea and Polio. The wells are life savers.

They give the villagers fresh, clean water that is free to all. Some of the wells are similar to traditional wells and others are from bore holes. They were built by the local people.
